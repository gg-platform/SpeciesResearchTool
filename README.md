## Technical Information

- **Data Fetching:** The tool retrieves occurrence records in JSON format directly from the NBN Atlas API using the provided URL.
- **Data Processing:** Records are parsed and grouped by key fields such as date, taxonomic class, and data provider. The app summarizes counts, filters duplicates, and extracts relevant metadata.
- **BoCC Comparison:** For bird records, the tool cross-references species names with the Birds of Conservation Concern 5 (BoCC) list to highlight conservation status.
- **Visualization:** Data is displayed using interactive charts (e.g., bar charts by month/class/provider) and a map powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. Large datasets are clustered for performance.
- **Privacy:** No data is stored on a server; all processing happens in your browser session.
